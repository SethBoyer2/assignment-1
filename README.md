# COMP-1327 Assignment 1

## Description

In this project I am demonstrating my understanding of the following:

- Setting up a project.
- Initializing a GIT repository.
- Performing version control tasks using GIT.

## First git status output:

$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

## Second git status output:

$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

## Purpose of the following Commands:

- `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.
- `cd`: Changes your present working directory.
- `code`: used to open a file in your code editor. Ie Code README.md will open readme in your default code editor.
- `ls`: Lists all files and other directories within your present working directory.

## Why Version Control is Important

With version control, it is possible to:

- Branch & Merge different versions of the same project, allowing users to work on different issues at the same time, or take the project and go in a completely different direction, without having to worry about different versions getting mixed up

- easily undo and track changes made to files and directories

- Control & Restrict access to certain parts of projects, allowing for easy collaboration and management without any hassle or worry

- Annotated changes allow users to make changes with quick summaries of changes made, making it easy for team members to keep track of what has and has not been done, as well as track contributions from each team member

## Purpose of the following Git Commands

- `git init`: Takes regular folder and turns it into local repository
- `git status`: Tells you what's going on (Files staged for commit, what branch you are working in)
- `git add`: stages files to prepare them for commit
- `git commit`: Commits your changes locally
- `git push`: Takes committed changes and pushes them to the remote repository
- `git pull`: Takes changes from a remote repo and merges them to your current branch
- `git log`: displays a list of commits, along with their comments, as well as the date and time they were committed
- `git branch`: Displays your current branch
- `git merge`: used to merge branches. 
- `git checkout`: Used to change branches or create new branches

## My Unique Touch

There are things that set me apart from others:

- I send yeat guitar remixes to the class chat
- I drink so much water
- I, unlike many others, need to breathe oxygen to live
- I am a very conscientious person
